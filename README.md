# Tsao_Sandra_1055_SVG

This project is to show our ability of designing svg icons from illustrator and use css/javascript to create effects for icons placed on a webpage.

## Installation

Please download the folder from this [GitHub](https://github.com/SandraTsao/Tsao_Sandra_1055_SVG.git). Open index.html inside the repository folder with browser [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)and you should have the icons shown on a webpage.

## Usage

Point your cursor to the icons on the webpage and you should see the hover effects happen. When you click on the icons, there would be massage from the webpage telling you what the icon means. You would also see the icons disappear when you shrink the size of your window to lower than "500px".
